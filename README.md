I recently completed an engaging Crocodile Data Analysis Dashboard project that dives deep into various aspects of crocodile data. The dashboard provides insights into length and weight distributions, with the largest crocodile recorded at 6.12 meters and weighing 1,139.7 kg. It explores habitats, showing that rivers and swamps are the most common environments, and includes gender analysis, revealing a balanced count of males and females alongside a notable amount of unknown data. The species insights highlight that saltwater crocodiles are the largest and heaviest. Through interactive visualizations, the dashboard makes it easy to compare patterns across habitats, species, and global distribution. This project strengthened my data visualization, dashboard creation, and storytelling skills, enabling me to transform complex data into meaningful insights.

Corona Analysis

I‚Äôm excited to share my latest project, the COVID-19 Analysis Dashboard, developed using Advanced Excel to provide a comprehensive view of global COVID-19 statistics. This dashboard analyzes total cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases, with interactive features including a world map and country-wise bar charts. Key insights highlight 67,531,926 total cases, 6,763,000 deaths, and 62,872,077 recoveries, with the USA, India, and Brazil leading in case counts. Users can explore country-specific data through interactive map filters, while trend analysis and visualizations make it easy to compare cases, deaths, and recoveries across countries. By integrating KPIs, color-coded charts, and a clean layout, the dashboard effectively communicates critical COVID-19 patterns. This project strengthened my skills in data visualization, pivot tables, pivot charts, and dashboard creation in Excel, enabling clear and impactful storytelling with data.

Adult Data Analysis

![ADULT DATA DASHBOARD](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a441586-9b20-4c01-954b-5b324fec07cd)

I recently completed an Adult Data Dashboard project in Excel, designed to provide an interactive, data-driven overview of adult demographics, occupations, and income distribution. The analysis covers 32,561+ records and reveals key insights such as gender distribution (21,790 males and 10,771 females), the relationship between marital status and hours worked, and how higher education levels correlate with higher incomes exceeding $50K. The dashboard also highlights occupation trends, showing that executive managers and professionals dominate the higher income bracket, and uncovers patterns in age across education levels. By examining how categorical variables like marital status, occupation, education, and gender influence income and work behavior, this project demonstrates the power of Excel in transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights through effective visualization and storytelling.
